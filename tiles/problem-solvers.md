    <p class="name">Georges Labrèche</p>
    <p class="title">Systems Engineer</p>
    <p class="bio">Hailing from the space sector, Georges' unforgiving expectations in delivering robust and reliable systems are rooted in his experiences as a software engineer at the European Space Agency where he developed fault-safe satellite software with no margin for error. He has a knack for catching problems before they happen. Georges is passionate about continuous learning and somehow manages to fit his schedule with co-authoring research papers, lecturing for the University of Turin, and public speaking about satellite data processing.</p>
